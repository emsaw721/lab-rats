## Visuals

## Installation 
In order for this application to work, the user will need to install the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html">Express</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars">Express Handlebars</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session">Express session</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2">MySQL2</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize">Sequelize</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize">connect-session-sequelize</a> packages. The user will also need to install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv">dotenv</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt">bcrypt</a> to hide sensitve information like the database password.

## Usage

First, the user will open the terminal and navigate to the application. <br>
Then, the user will run mysql2 using either the command: 

 > % mysql -u root

or

> % mysql -u root -p 

if there is no set password or a set password, respectively. This will create the database. <br>
Once it is confirmed that the database is created and in use, the user can exit mysql using the command: 

 > % quit

The user can then interact with the application by typing 

 > npm start 

into the terminal and navigating to the browser and typing the following into the search bar:

 > localhost:3001

Or, the user can enter the following link into the search bar:
 > https://obscure-lake-69191.herokuapp.com

 There, the user can sign-in if they have already created an account or can click the link to sign-up if they have not.

After signing-in or signing-up, the user will be taken to their dashboard. An existing user will see their previous lab notebooks with the options to view the experiments contained within, edit the notebook, or create a new notebook.

If they are a new user, they will see an empty dashboard with the option to create their first notebook.

## Support

## Roadmap
Future iterations of this application will include the ability to add a manager and will allow only users with proper authorization to access lab entries.
